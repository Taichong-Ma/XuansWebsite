      p As has been mentioned in previous section, <strong>Gulp</strong> is a JavaScript task runner. It helps with performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc. This is possible thanks to extensive Gulp Plugins library.
      p
        | Gulp tasks are already set up for you. They are stored inside <code>Createx/gulpfile.js</code>. But in order to have access to them via you Command Line tool you will need to install <strong>gulp-cli node package</strong>. Gulp CLI stands for Gulp Command Line Interface. 
        u.d-block To do that type following line in your terminal:
      kbd.d-inline-block.mb-3 npm install -g gulp-cli
      span.d-block.text-info.mb-4 * if you are on Mac make sure to use <strong>sudo</strong> to install packages globally otherwise you may runt into error.
